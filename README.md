Below is the URL to the dataset I have chosen, 'U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)'. 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi

The U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset interests me because it offers comprehensive data on health conditions and risk factors across various populations, directly tying to my interest in studying the impact of societal stressors. By analyzing this dataset, I aim to uncover correlations between chronic diseases and socio-economic factors, such as poverty or limited healthcare access, to identify disparities in health outcomes. My goal is to use these findings to advocate for and bring attention to targeted interventions and policies that mitigate the health impacts of chronic stress and trauma.
