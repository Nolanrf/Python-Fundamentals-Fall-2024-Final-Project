Below is the URL to the dataset I have chosen, 'Fruit-Prices-2022.csv' and 'Vegetable-Prices-2022.csv'.
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/fruit-and-vegetable-prices.aspx

The Fruit-Prices-2022.csv and Vegetable-Prices-2022.csv dataset interests me because it provides insights into the pricing of fruits and vegetables, which can reveal patterns related to economic accessibility, seasonality, and regional variations in fruit/vegetable costs. I aim to explore how food prices differ across locations, the relationship between price trends and economic factors, and the affordability of nutritious options for low-income populations. This analysis aligns with my broader interest in public health and socio-economic disparities, as it could uncover barriers to healthy eating and suggest interventions to improve food accessibility. I hope to identify actionable insights that promote healthier dietary habits and equitable access to fresh produce.
